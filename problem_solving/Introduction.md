# Problem Solving for developers

## Framwork to look at any problem
we will be taking examples of following three problems.
1. I have 20 projects build by me and by resume HR can not see them in action.
2. i have a file with 800 photos and all has a numerical number but this is meaning less. but i am using the files to geo tag to map. but when ever i see one image as geo tagged to location i am not sure is that correctly tagged or not.
3. i have 600 pull request to be merged to my branch.
### Identify the problem
#### Context
what we want to achieve or do.
1. HR must see the work in action.
2. I must update name of files with geo location.
3. we must merge 600 pull requests.

#### issue
why is this a problem? 
1. it would reduce my chances to be selected for a job.
2. i might tag wrong image to the location.
3 .it would take days to to close all pull requests.EE
#### why do i care?
1. i will impress the HR.
2. QA is easy.
3. will save us millions of dollar
### Research and refine
* look for already available solutions.
* there is no issue taking others solution and build on it.
* break the problem in smaller problems.
1. i can add links to resume or build a portfolio. Portfolio it self show the coding skills so i should build the portfolio. think about the UI, backend, tack stack as a smaller problems and those can also be subdivided.
2. i might find some script that rename the files. now we need to just fetch the location of the file fro its metadata and rename the name. so this has two sub problems to be solved fetching location and renaming it.

### Write pseudocode
it is good idea to write the pseudocode without worrying about the syntax of program. 
### TDD
Use Test driven developemnt. because it defiantly saves lot of time.
### Implement
implement the working solution as fast as you can without worrying about the efficiency, time complexity, solid principles etc just focus on developing working prototype.
### Reflect and improve
Now you can reflect on the working solution to improve on following things.
1. improve readability
2. add comments
3. remove duplication
4. optimize the time complexity/space complexity
5. add error handling.
ETC...
### Practice
Keep solving challenging problems.
