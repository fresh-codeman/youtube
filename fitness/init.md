# Best plan for weight loss.

As of now my weight is 88 and height is 5'10''. So i need to reduce the weight and here is the structured approach.

## Diet Adjustments

Caloric Deficit: Aim to consume fewer calories than you burn. A daily deficit of 500–700 kcal can help you lose 0.5–1 kg per week.
Protein Intake: Eat lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, eggs) to maintain muscle mass.
Reduce Processed Foods: Avoid sugary drinks, deep-fried items, and processed snacks.
Increase Fiber: Eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes to stay full longer.
Hydration: Drink at least 3 liters of water daily. Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger.
